# Rest API Generator

Built in KnockoutJS and Python, this teeny, tiny website, which lives locally on your computer, provides a graphical interface for creating, generating, and implementing a postgres SQL database for use in some kinda web development. Very simple, very easy to use.

### ** Note: ** I was using a script called git-zoom for some git commits. It wasn't working correctly. If you are curious what the $ commits do, ask me and I can provide some clarification

#Future

1. Provide extensibility for Python script to accept commandline arguments
2. Further extend Python script to generate nodeJS/expressJS/squel and when.js routes for use in a REST API
3. Compound keys


## Libraries used:
* JavaScript
	* devtools-snippet
	* jquery
	* knockoutjs
* Python
	* sys
	* os
	* json
